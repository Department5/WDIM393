      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>I started off with a background in art and pushed towards design, but my desire to travel has me searching for more web based work.  My favorite language is <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> - followed directly by english - but <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, Javascript/jQuery/Ajax, <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, and <abbr title="My Structured Query Language">MySQL</abbr> are pretty cool too; and Content Management Systems are the shit. On that most basic level, I love building things, and watching it develop as I go.  While off duty, I'm usually outside doing something active, or grabbing drinks with friends.</p>
      <p>My goal is to bring things full circle: from strategy to design and print to web, the desktop to the phone, and back again.</p>
      <h3>Specialties:</h3>
      <p>Brand Development, Graphic Design (print), Web Design &amp; Front End <abbr title="Development">Dev</abbr>, A Responsiveness to Browser's Needs (they dig me), Illustration (Drawing + Painting + Digital), Logos, Photos, Writing, and Ads.</p>
      <p>WordPress, Drupal, Shopify, and Interface.</p>
      <h3>Super Power:</h3>
      <p>Large Hands and Feet (2/3 ain't bad)</p>
      <h3>Claim to Fame:</h3>
      <p>I am that one guy&hellip;</p>

      <p>Since High School I've spent a year at OSU, a bit o' time at the School of Hard Knocks, a couple terms at community college, travelled to a few new corners of the world, and finally ended up here at The Art Institute. Always have had interest in painting and drawing, which in the past 3 years has turned to an interest in Graphic design, and finally, Web Design.</p>
      <p>Off the computer I can be found: Snowboarding, skateboarding, painting, spontaniously travelling, and sipping some whiskey on the weekends.</p>
      <h3>Specialties:</h3>
       <p>Web design/Front End Development, Logo Design, Branding, Photoshop, Illustrator, a bit of Javascript/jQuery. A fan of clean typography, simple color pallets, </p>
      <h3>Super Power:</h3>
      <p>Flippin' (and Floppin') on a snowboard</p>
